Of course! Let me transcribe and explain the content from the image you uploaded in detail:

## **Chapter 8: TRADEMARKS**

### **Introduction**

* A Trademark (or Trade Mark) is described as a **distinctive symbol** that helps recognize and distinguish the products or services of one company from those offered by others.
* The word "Mark" refers to **a sign, design, phrase, slogan, symbol, name, numeral, device, or a combination** of these elements.
* A trademark essentially represents **anything that connects a brand to the general public**.

### **8.1 Eligibility Criteria**

For goods or services to qualify as a trademark under legal classification, they must fulfill these conditions:

1. **Distinctiveness**

   * Goods and services seeking protection must have enough **uniqueness** to be recognized as a trademark.
   * They should be capable of identifying the **origin of goods or services** in the market.

2. **Non-Descriptiveness**

   * A trademark should not merely describe the **characteristics** of the goods or services.
   * Descriptive marks are generally not protected under Trademark law.
   * However, **descriptive terms can still be registered if they acquire a "secondary meaning."**

     * Example: The brand name **â€˜Appleâ€™** used by a U.S.-based multinational company for electronic devices.

3. **Dissimilarity from existing marks**

   * The mark must be **distinctive** and must not closely resemble or bear similarity to already existing trademarks.

### **8.2 Who can apply for a Trademark?**

* **Any individual** who owns a trademark has the right to apply for registration.
* Applications can also be filed by **multiple applicants** together, with the necessary documents.
* An **organization or association** can apply for a **collective mark**, which can then be used by all its members.

  * Example: The **â€˜Relianceâ€™ symbol** is a collective mark representing all products linked with the organization.

ðŸ‘‰ In simple words:

* A **trademark protects uniqueness** of brands.
* To be valid, it must be **distinctive, non-descriptive, and different from existing marks**.
* Applications can be made by **individuals, multiple people, or organizations**.
